        <p class="text">Beef Wellington is a dish that consists of a cut of beef that is coated in paté, wrapped in puff pastry, and baked until the pastry is a beautiful golden brown. The classic English dish is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.</p>

        <div class="text">
            1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li><br/><br/>

            3. Bake in the preheated oven until browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Remove beef from the pan and reserve pan juices; allow beef to cool completely.<br/><br/>

            4. Increase oven temperature to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).<br/><br/>
            5. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté onion and mushrooms in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.<br/><br/>

            6. Mix paté and remaining 2 tablespoons softened butter together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spread paté mixture over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.<br/><br/>

            7. Roll out puff pastry dough to about 1/4-inch thickness and place beef in the center.<br/><br/>

            8. Fold up and seal all the edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13-inch baking dish, cut a few slits in the top of dough, and brush with egg yolk.<br/><br/>

            9. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) and continue baking until pastry is a rich, golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read between 122 to 130 degrees F (50 to 54 degrees C) for medium rare. Set aside to rest.<br/><br/>

            10. Meanwhile, place reserved pan juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef broth and red wine; boil until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Strain and serve with beef.<br/><br/>
